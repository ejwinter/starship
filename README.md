# Starship Explorer

This application was created as part of a development job interview.

The goal was to create an application using a public API that implemented some key web front end features.  We will then perform a code review.

This application utlitizes the SWAPI (Star Wars API) available at https://swapi.dev.  It appears the CORS is set up to allow localhost, so it works for local 
development but does not work if you try to deploy to Azure (for instance).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
